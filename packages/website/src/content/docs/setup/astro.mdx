title: Using Spotlight with Astro
description: A guide how to setup Spotlight for Astro
---

Setting up Spotlight in Astro easy using Astro's extension system.

Start by adding the `@sentry/astro` and `@spotlightjs/astro` dependencies:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npx astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After that, Astro should add the Sentry & Spotlight integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file and should look something like this.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  
                                               
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";           
import spotlightjs from "@spotlightjs/astro"; 
                                               
// https://astro.build/config                 
export default defineConfig({
  // Order matters here! `spotlightjs()` should come after `sentry()`                 
  integrations: [sentry(), spotlightjs()]     
});
```

:::note[Sentry in Production]
If you're using Sentry in production, don't forget to bind the `DSN` and source map configuration:

See [Sentry's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/) for more information.

## Configure Other Sentry SDKs

If your Astro application is interacting with other services, such as a Python API, you can also configure those SDKs to work with Spotlight. You don't need to be using the Sentry service to take advantage of Sentry's SDKs to power Spotlight.

import { Content as SentryCodeBlock } from '../../../components/sentryCodeBlock.mdx';
