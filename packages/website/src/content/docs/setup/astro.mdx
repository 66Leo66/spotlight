## Install Sentry & Spotlight

To install Sentry and Spotlight for Astro call:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npx astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After that, Astro should add the Sentry & Spotlight integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file and should look something like this.

```js
 import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  
                                               
 import sentry from "@sentry/astro";           
 import spotlightjs from "@spotlightjs/astro"; 
                                               
 // https://astro.build/config                 
 export default defineConfig({                 
   integrations: [sentry(), spotlightjs()]     
 });
```

:::note

The order of the integrations is important. Sentry should be the first integration in the array, followed by Spotlight.

To complete your setup, you need to add your Sentry DSN to the `astro.config.mjs` file.
See [Sentry's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/) for more information.
You final Sentry config should look something like this:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
sentry({
    dsn: "DSN",
    sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
      project: "PROJECT_NAME",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    },
  }),
//...
```
