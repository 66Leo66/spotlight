title: Setup Spotlight with Sentry's SDKs
description: Use Spotlight with Sentry
---

Spotlight is built that you don't need Sentry to run it. 
It can contain any kind of integration. 
However, Sentry is the first integration we've built for Spotlight and it's a **great way to get started**.

If you want your Sentry SDKs to talk to the Sidecar, enable the `spotlight` setting.
You don't need a `dsn` for Spotlight to work.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript (Browser)">
  In the Browser you don't need to set `spotlight: true`, `Spotlight.init()` will automatically detect if Sentry is available and if so, hook into the SDK.
  ```javascript 
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: '___DSN___',
    });
    // In the frontend it's important that you init Spotlight after Sentry
    Spotlight.init();
  ```
  </TabItem>
