title: Using Spotlight in your Environment
description: A guide how to setup Spotlight in your environment
---

Spotlight can be used with a variety of frameworks and even in your custom environment. See other guides like [Astro](/setup/astro/) if you want to use Spotlight with a specific framework.


While it's not dependent on Sentry's SDKs it's recommended to use them to get the most out of Spotlight.

## Frontend

### Install

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npm add --save-dev @spotlightjs/core 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm add -D @spotlightjs/core
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn add @spotlightjs/core -D
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup

```js
import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/core';

Spotlight.init();
```

## Backend

If you run Sentry also on your backend you need to tell the SDK to connect to Spotlight.

### Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npm add --save-dev @spotlightjs/sidecar 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm add -D @spotlightjs/sidecar
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn add @spotlightjs/sidecar -D
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
import { connect } from '@spotlightjs/sidecar/connect'
// ....
Sentry.init({...});
connect(Sentry.getCurrentHub()); // call connect right after Sentry.init
```
