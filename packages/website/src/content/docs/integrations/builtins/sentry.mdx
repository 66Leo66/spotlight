title: Sentry
---

The Sentry integration is the default in Spotlight. It receives events and envelope formats from Sentry SDKs (when configured with `spotlight=true`) and renders those as Errors and Traces in the overlay.

```ts
import { init, sentry } from "@spotlightjs/core";

init({
  integrations: [sentry()]
});
```

<button style="cursor: pointer" onclick="throw new Error('Client Side Error')">
  Throw a Test Error and open Spotlight
</button>
